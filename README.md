## Problem Statement <br />

Dasboard 2 overview <br />
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements: <br />
Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).<br />
Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.<br />
Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) <br />
Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.<br />
Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.<br />
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.<br />


CHARTS <br />
Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities <br />
1.Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities <br />
2.Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths. <br />
3.Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications. <br />
4.Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing. <br />
5.Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements. <br />
6.Metrics to be shown: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received' <br />
